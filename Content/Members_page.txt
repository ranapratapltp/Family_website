Rana Pratap Singh

I am Rana Pratap . I am a programmer and passionate web developer. Currently I have learnt HTML, CSS in web development. I've made projects also using these. One of those is this one. This project is made just on my father's demand. So I made it. Also, I'm learning JAVA and soon will be working on projects using it. My additional skill is graphic designing, which helps me to design my own awesome websites and beautiful interfaces.
